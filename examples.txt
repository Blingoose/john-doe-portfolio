 Salutations, I'm Alex Rover, a digital nomad thriving in the realm of web development and mobile UI/UX design. From a cozy corner in my sun-drenched hometown, I delve into the intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, exploring their countless frameworks and libraries. The world of coding is my playground and I love the thrill of breaking barriers and creating something new every single day. When I'm not busy crafting digital experiences, I share my coding escapades on my YouTube channel
